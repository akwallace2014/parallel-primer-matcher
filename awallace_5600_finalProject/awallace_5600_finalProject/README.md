Final Project

## Run Instructions 

Program is built to not require any user input to run and demonstrate function.

Note: All required files for demos are in 'main' package.  Unit tests (JUnit 5)
are included to demonstrate thoroughness in testing and design but do not need
to be run. If using Makefile and terminal unit test classes are not included.

# Option 1: IDE

1.  Open the awallace_5600_finalProject folder in your IDE.
2.  Project structure is such that no reconfiguration should be necessary.
3.  Run main method in PrimerMatcher.java

# Option 2: Terminal 

1.  Navigate to awallace_5600_finalProject/src/main in the CLI
2.  enter `make all` - all classes should compile
