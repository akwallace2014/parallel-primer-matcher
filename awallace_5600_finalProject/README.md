Final Project

## Run Instructions & Notes

Program is built to not require any user input to run and demonstrate function.

There are no separate sequential and parallel versions of driver, the main driver demonstrates and compares throughput for both in a single run.  

All required files for demos are in 'main' package.  Unit tests (JUnit 5)
are included to demonstrate thoroughness in testing and design but do not need
to be run.

This program was developed in Visual Studio Code on a Windows 10 machine with 
4 cores using Java version 13.0.1, where it compiled and ran successfully.
